scratchhh.tk is basically [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu) with more pros. This clone offers many features that are not available on Scratch.
It's obviously available [here](https://scratchhh.tk). Just please note that the site may be down for maintainance or something. That's why I offer local hosting!

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/themysticsavages/scratchhh.tk
