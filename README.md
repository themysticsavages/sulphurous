# scratchhh.web (wip)
scratchhh.web is a clone of the website [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu). This clone offers a calm dark mode and easy access to project downloading (in an non-obvious way).
I'm planning to make this availible on the domain **scratchhh.xyz**. This uses flask and scratchhh.
